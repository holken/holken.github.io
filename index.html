		<p> I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/rpl"> RPL (Robotics, Perception and Learning) </a>, in the social robotics group at KTH, Stockholm under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tyKNvM8AAAAJ&hl=en">Iolanda Leite</a>.</p>
    <p>
      My research revolves around reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). My contributions revolve around making the process more sample-efficient and granular in order to achieve better alignment with the human.
